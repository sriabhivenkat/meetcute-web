                    5. Controlling Your Information
                </h3>
                    You have control over the information that you share with MeetQT subject to certain limitations.

                    MeetQT’s Services have been built in a way to minimize the amount of information that is stored within them. Nonetheless, if you want to review, update, change or delete the information that you have shared with MeetQT, including deletion of your account, you may send a request to do so to sriabhi01@meetqt.com.

                    Even in the event that MeetQT deletes your information, MeetQT still may retain previous messages you sent and the profile associated with those messages. MeetQT may also retain certain information for legitimate business purposes such as maintenance of security of the Services or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, depending on the circumstances of such deletion. You understand and agree that MeetQT may have responsibility to law enforcement or other governmental entities or to its stakeholders, to maintain information if there is the possibility of any unsafe or illegal behavior to ensure the Services are not exploited in the future.

                    7. Age Restrictions

                    MeetQT does not knowingly collect or solicit the personal information of anyone under the age of 13, even with a parent or guardian’s consent. MeetQT is not intended for children and in the event that MeetQT determines that a person under 13 has provided personal information, we will delete that information immediately.
