# This is the official website for my app, Meetcute!
Check us out on www.meetqt.com!

I built this website mainly to show people what the app is about, but also a place to buy Meetcute merchandise and log into their Meetcute accounts to partner with us or buy vendor spots at our sponsored adventures.

Meetcute's repository is private for now, as the app has some sensitive information.

It uses a PostgreSQL backend with React.js, Node.js, and Express.js.
